 <summary> Yosys </summary>
Yosys is an open-source framework for Verilog RTL synthesis. RTL stands for Register Transfer Level, which is a high-level abstraction used to describe digital circuits at the level of registers and their interactions. Yosys is primarily used in the digital design and electronic design automation (EDA) community to convert RTL descriptions of digital circuits, written in languages like Verilog or SystemVerilog, into a netlist representation that can be further optimized, analyzed, and eventually implemented in hardware.

I installed Yosys using the following commands and Below is the screenshot showing sucessful launch:
