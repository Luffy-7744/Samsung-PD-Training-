## Day-1-Introduction to Verilog RTL Design and Synthesis
<details>
 <summary> Introduction to RTL-Design, Test-bench, Simulators </summary>
-RTL Design : The RTL Design stands for Register Transfer Language. It sits between the high-level system specification and the lower-level gate-level implementation. This is a design abstraction which models the flow of digital signals between hardware registers, and the logical operations performed on those signals. RTL is preferred because it is easy to understand and implement compared to structural and behavioral models.

-HDL : A hardware description language (HDL) enables a precise, formal description of an electronic circuit that allows for the automated analysis and simulation of an electronic circuit.

-Simulator : Simulator is the tool used for checking adherence to the specification by simulating the design. iverilog is the tool used for RTL simulation. A simulator looks for change in the input signals and when no change in input, the output also doesn't change. It produces an output in the form of a .vcd file.

-Design : Design is the actual verilog code or set of Verilog codeswhich has the intended functionality to meet the required specifications. Design may have one or more primary inputs or primary outputs.  RTL design is the behavioral representation of the required specification.

<summary> Labs on examples of iverilog and gtkwave </summary>
We made a directory namely VLSI and inside that directory we cloned vsdflow and sky130RTLDesignAndSynthesisWorkshop repository. This repository consists of the required .lib files and verilog codes and its testbenches for practice.
Below is the output wave form in gtkwave generated by performing a simulation of good_mux using iverilog.
The syntax of the code is: iverilog <RTL_code> <Its_Testbench>

 <summary> Introduction to Yosys </summary>
-Synthesis: Synthesis in VLSI is the process of converting your code (program) into a circuit. In terms of logic gates, synthesis is the process of translating an abstract design into a properly implemented chip. It is a process of converting a RTL code into a gate level netlist. The tool used for this purpose is called synthesizer.

-Yosys : Yosys is a framework for RTL synthesis and more. It currently has extensive Verilog-2005 support and provides a basic set of synthesis algorithms for various application domains. Yosys is the core component of most our implementation and verification flows.

-Verification of synthesized design : In order to make sure that there are no errors in netlist we need to verify the netlist generated by synthesizer. This can be done by giving netlist and testbench to a simulator which in turn produces a .vcd file , then verifying the vcd file gtkwave. The output produced by this vcd file should be same as the one generated by the RTL design code.

-Faster Cells Vs Slower Cells :Load in digital circuit is of Capacitence. Faster the charging or dicharging of capacitance, lesser is the celll delay. However, for a quick charge/ discharge of capacitor, we need transistors capable of sourcing more current i.e, we need WIDE TRANSISTORS.

Transistors with higher W/L have lesser delay but consume more area and power while Transistors with less W/L has more delay and less area. Faster cells come with a cost of area and power.

Selection of the Cells: Based on timing constraints we need select the cell. Setup supports faster cells in datapath while hold supports slower. We need to select suitable which can satisfy both constraints.
<details>
 <summary> Lab work on Yosys </summary>
We were given the overview of this tool and the basic files required to perform the experiment on 2:1 MUX.
Procedure : First we need to read the liberty file (.lib) using the code: read_liberty -lib <path of the .lib>


Read the RTL code:

read_verilog <RTL_Design_file>

For synthesis:

synth -top <instance_name>

For Generating netlist:

abc -liberty <.lib path>  --------<present_on_lib_folder>
This Netlist can be viewed in the synthesized circuit form which uses std. cell present in .lib using the show command :

## Day-2-Introduction to Timing libraries, Hierarchical vs flat synthesis, and flip flop coding

<details>
 <summary> Introduction to Timing Library File (.Lib) </summary>
Liberty File(.lib) contains important info about the electrical behavior  of std cells used in IC design. Also, Liberty File(.lib) consists of ASCII representations of Timing, Area, and Power associated with the Standard cell. The Naming convention in the timing file follows technology node and PVT format (Process, Voltage, Temperature). For example, the standard library used in our case was sky130_fd_sc_hd_tt_025C_1v8, this name suggests that we are using 130 nm technology and the process is typical(tt), temperature is 25C, and 1v8 represents the 1.8V.
Screenshot of a standard library file shown below: 
<img width="1085" alt="lib" src="https://github.com/Luffy-7744/Samsung-PD-Training-/blob/6e256528c8de9193640fb445f589071e23beeee5/PD%23Day2/lib_part1.PNG">
	
The Liberty File also consists of the technology used for standard cells as in the above example it is CMOS, it also specifies the delay model, unit of time, unit of voltage, unit of resistance, and many other units.
All the data i.e std cells delays, leakage power, capacitance is stored in form of LUTs. For each gate cell based on the number of inputs(N), there will be 2^N combinations, and for each combination leakage power, area, delay, and all related parameters are mentioned. For example, consider the below screenshot the gate mentioned in the screenshot consists of 4 inputs so there will be 16 combinations, and for all the combinations power, delay, value, and all the features are mentioned below.
<img width="1085" alt="lib1" src="https://github.com/Luffy-7744/Samsung-PD-Training-/blob/6e256528c8de9193640fb445f589071e23beeee5/PD%23Day2/lib_part2.PNG">
	
The timing file consists of many different variations of the same gate cells. As we move toward faster cell (cell with higher drive strength) the area and power increases. In liberty file area, power, timing values are given for same cell of different drive strength and it also consist if the inform about leakage power of all the possible logic of different configration shown below.
<img width="1085" alt="lib1" src="https://github.com/Luffy-7744/Samsung-PD-Training-/blob/a69147a2bedd2c78636125b3b35b7996fa55659e/PD%23Day2/lib_part3.PNG">

<details>
 <summary> Hierarchical vs Flat synthesis in Yosys </summary>
Hierarchical synthesis : The basic flow of hierarchical design is Dividing a design into multiple blocks (i.e. sub-chips, sub-blocks, modules, hierarchical blocks, etc.) which can also be user defined. Hierarchial design has blocks, subblocks in an hierarchy.
In Yosys we have done synthesis of a multimodule combinational circuit which consists of two sub_modules one that of ** AND ** gate and other of ** OR ** gate. Below is the RTL Design code of multimodules is gvien below:
	Synthesis Simulation Mismatch
```
module sub_module2 (input a, input b, output y);
        assign y = a | b;
endmodule

module sub_module1 (input a, input b, output y);
        assign y = a&b;
endmodule
```

module multiple_modules (input a, input b, input c , output y);
        wire net1;
        sub_module1 u1(.a(a),.b(b),.y(net1));  //net1 = a&b
        sub_module2 u2(.a(net1),.b(c),.y(y));  //y = net1|c ,ie y = a&b + c;
endmodule
```
We do synthesis in yosys it generates the following gate level netlist :

<img width="1085" alt="lib" src="https://github.com/Luffy-7744/Samsung-PD-Training-/blob/7d2732dc1300198990edfb77ed38ef0cff0db911/PD%23Day2/hire_synth.PNG">

The yosys considers the module hierarchy and does mapping according to the instantiation i.e by using sub blocks.The netlist code for hierarchical implementation of the multiple_modules.
```
module multiple_modules(a, b, c, y);
	  input a;
	 input b;
	 input c;
	  wire net1;
	 output y;
  sub_module1 u1 (.a(a),.b(b),.y(net1) );
  sub_module2 u2 (.a(net1),.b(c),.y(y));
endmodule

module sub_module1(a, b, y);
 wire _0_;
 wire _1_;
 wire _2_;
 input a;
 input b;
 output y;
 sky130_fd_sc_hd__and2_0 _3_ (.A(_1_),.B(_0_),.X(_2_));
 assign _1_ = b;
 assign _0_ = a;
 assign y = _2_;
endmodule

module sub_module2(a, b, y);
wire _0_;
 wire _1_;
 wire _2_;
input a;
input b;
 output y;
 sky130_fd_sc_hd__lpflow_inputiso1p_1 _3_ (.A(_1_),.SLEEP(_0_),.X(_2_) );
 assign _1_ = b;
 assign _0_ = a;
 assign y = _2_;
endmodule
```
In the netlist it can observed that separate modules namely sub_module1 sub_module2 are created  i.e submodules are getting instanstiated not the std cells present in library.

Flat synthesis : In Flat synthesis the hierarchies the flattened out and every submodule is created using std cells. We apply flat synthesis on the same design mentioned above. The command used to perform Flat synthesis from yosys are as follows :

--- read_liberty -lib <path of the .lib>

--- read_verilog <RTL_file>

--- synth -top <instance_name>

--- abc -liberty <.lib_path>

--- flatten

--- write_verilog -noattr <.v_File_name>
The synthesized circuit for a flattened netlist is shown in the below:

 <summary> Flip-flop Coding Styles </summary>

 Flip-flops :A flip-flop is a sequential digital electronic circuit having two stable states that can be used to store one bit of binary data. Flip-flops are the fundamental building blocks of all memory devices.

 The complexity of cobinational circuit increases the chance of glitch, hence FFs are used to avoid it and it stable output.

 <summary> Optimization Techniques </summary>
 The Optimization involves the reducing hardware in the design to improve area, power and speed. Two example where given:
 1. a*2
Consider a case where 3 bit number is multiplied by 2 in this case we dont need any additional hardware and only needs connecting bits to the output and grounding the LSB bit,same is realized by yosys. When binary number is multiplied by 2^n then result will gave same number by appending zero in LSB by n times.
RTL code:
	
```
	module mul2 (input [2:0] a, output [3:0] y);
	assign y = a * 2; // assign y={a,1'b0}
	endmodule
```

Yosys Synthesis result :

 2. a*9
Multiplying a 3 bit number by 9, gives results as concatination of same number twice {a,a}.
a*[8+1]= {a,0,0,0} + a(3bit)={a,a}

RTL code:

```
module mul8 (input [2:0] a, output [5:0] y);
	assign y = a * 9; // assign y={a,a}
endmodule
```

## Day-3- Combinational and sequential optmizations

<details>
 <summary> Combinational Optimization </summary>
Optimising the combinational logic circuit is squeezing the logic to get the most optimized digital design so that the circuit finally is area and power efficient. This is achieved by the synthesis tool using various techniques and gives us the most optimized circuit.
Command to optimize the circuit by yosys is yosys> opt_clean -purge
We have done synthesis using yosys for few examples:

*Example 1*
```
module opt_check (input a , input b , output y);
	assign y = a?b:0;
endmodule
```
yosys generated gui:

In this verilog code represents the mux but as one of the input 0 , it infers an AND gate as shown in synthesis.


*Example 2*
```
module opt_check2 (input a , input b , output y);
	assign y = a?1:b;
endmodule
```

In this verilog code represents the mux but as one of the input 1, it infers an AND gate as shown in synthesis.

*Example 3*
```
module opt_check3 (input a , input b, input c , output y);

In this verilog code represents the 2 mux but as two of the input 0, it infers an 3 i/p AND gate as shown in synthesis.


*Example 4*
```
module opt_check4 (input a , input b , input c , output y);
	assign y = a?(b?(a & c ):c):(!c);
endmodule
```

 <summary> Sequential Optimization </summary>
There are various techniques for Sequential Logic Optimization

    - Sequentialal constant propagation

    - Advanced

        - State Optimization

        - Retiming

        - Sequential Logic cloning

 Sequential Constant Propogation

Consider a case where asynchronous reset D Flip-flop is fed with d = 0(i.e GND) always so the output will always be 0 irrespective of the timing or circuit.

 Advanced

State Optimisation: This is optimisation of unused state. Using this technique we can come up with most optimised state machine.

Cloning : It is an optimization technique that duplicates a cell to reduce the load on heavily loaded cell. This technique is usually preffered while performing PHYSICAL AWARE SYNTHESIS. Lets consider a flop A which is connected to flop B and flop C through a combination logic. If B and C are placed far from A in the flooerplan, there is a routing path delay. To avoid this, we connect A to two intermediate flops and then from these flops the output is sent to B and C thereby decreasing the delay. This process is called cloning since we are generating two new flops with same functionality as A.

Retiming : Sequential circuits can be optimised by retiming. The combinational section of the circuitry is unaffected as it only rearranges the registers in the circuit. It is a powerful sequential optimization technique used to move registers across the combinational logic or to optimize the number of registers to improve performance via power-delay trade-off, without changing the input-output behavior of the circuit.

Sequential Constant Propogation

Consider a case where asynchronous reset D Flip-flop is fed with d = 0(i.e GND) always so the output will always be 0 irrespective of the timing or circuit.

## Day-4- GLS,blocking vs non-blocking and Synthesis-Simulation mismatch

<details>
<summary> GLS Concepts And Flow Using Iverilog </summary>

-- What is GLS- Gate Level Simulation?:
GLS is generating the simulation output by running test bench with netlist file generated from synthesis as design under test. Netlist is logically same as RTL code, therefore, same test bench can be used for it.

-- Why GLS?:
We perform this to verify logical correctness of the design after synthesizing it. Also ensuring the timing of the design is met.

Below picture gives an insight of the procedure. Here while using iverilog, we also include gate level verilog models to generate GLS simulation.

<img width="1085" alt="lib1" src="https://github.com/Luffy-7744/Samsung-PD-Training-/blob/d17cd858582bb157db097c5bdab07548794e008d/PD%23Day4/IMG_6766.png">
Example :
<img width="1085" alt="lib1" src="https://github.com/Luffy-7744/Samsung-PD-Training-/blob/8d9343b03653b5480cb54ca9d97e32782986ba8c/PD%23Day4/IMG_6768.jpeg">

*Synthesis Simulation Mismatch* 
There are three main reasons for Synthesis Simulation Mismatch:

   -- Missing sensitivity list in always block
   -- Blocking vs Non-Blocking Assignments
   -- Non standard Verilog coding
Missing sensitivity list in always block:
Lets take example of mux having inputs as i0,i1 and sel and output as y.
```
always @(sel)                  always @(*)
//It will infer a latch        // It will infer a mux.
```
If i0 and i1 changes will not be reflected in always block.
To avoid the synthesis and simulation mismatch. It is very important to check the behaviour of the circuit first and then match it with the expected output seen in simulation and make sure there are no synthesis and simulation mismatches. This is why we use GLS.

Blocking vs Non-Blocking Assignments:
Blocking statements execute the statemetns in the order they are written inside the always block. Non-Blocking statements execute all the assignment parallelly inside a always block.
This will give mismatch as sometimes, improper use of blocking statements can create latches. 
Example
<img width="1085" alt="lib1" src="https://github.com/Luffy-7744/Samsung-PD-Training-/blob/8d9343b03653b5480cb54ca9d97e32782986ba8c/PD%23Day4/IMG_6769.jpeg">

## Day-5-Design For Testabilty(DFT)

<details>
<summary> Introduction to DFT </summary>
	
**What is Design for Testability, and why we need it?**

Today, semiconductors lie at the heart of ongoing advances across the electronics industry. The introduction of new technologies, has allowed the semiconductor industry to keep pace with increased performance-capacity demands from consumers. This has brightened the prospects for future industry growth.
However, new technologies come with new challenges. Smaller die sizes increase the probability of some errors. Errors in ICs are highly undesirable. 
In simple words, Design for testability is a design technique that makes testing a chip possible and cost-effective by adding additional circuitry to the chip.
Alternatively, Design-for-testability techniques improve the controllability and observability of internal nodes, so that embedded functions can be tested.

Now, Question arrises what is controllability and observability in design.
*Controllability*: Ability to establish aspecific signal value at each node in a circuit from setting values at the circuits inputs.
*Observability*: Ability to determine the signal value at any node in circuit by controlling the circuits input and observing its output.

**Role of DFT**
Testing of Sequential Circuits :
DFT offers a solution to the issue of testing sequential circuits. It’s kind of hard to test sequential circuits. Since there are clocks involved along with the flip-flops.
Unlike combinational circuits, we can’t determine the output of sequential circuits by merely looking into the inputs. Sequential circuits consist of finite states. The output also depends upon the state of the machine. It is difficult to control and observe the internal flip-flops externally.
Hence, the state machines cannot be tested unless they are initialized to a known value. And to initialize them, we need a specific set of features in addition to the typical circuitry. DFT enables us to add this functionality to a sequential circuit and thus allows us to test it.


**Can DFT permanently eliminate faults?**

No, faults can arise even after the chip is in consumer’s hands. A chip may misbehave anytime if it is exposed to a very high temperature or humid environment or due to aging.
You can even generate a fault on your own. A chip can’t ever be made resistant to faults; they are always bound to occur. So, what are we trying to achieve? Testing a device increases our confidence. By testing a chip, vendors try to minimize the possibility of future errors and failures.
To ensure the highest quality of chips, there is also an auxiliary process involved in the chip-design process called Verification.



**Some Terminologies**

Here are a few terminologies which we will often use in this free Design for Testability course. Don’t fret if you can’t completely understand them yet, we will be covering them in-depth in this course.

Testing: An experiment in which the system is put to work and its resulting response is analyzed to ascertain whether it behaved correctly.

Diagnosis: Process for locating the cause of misbehavior in the circuit if it happened.

Defect: Refers to a flaw in the actual hardware or electronic system.

Fault: It is a model or representation of defect for analyzing in a computer program.

Error: It is caused by a defect and happens when a fault in hardware causes line/ gate output to have a wrong value.

Failure: This occurs when a defect causes misbehavior in the circuit or functionality of a system and cannot be reversed or recovered.

Fault Coverage: Percentage of the total number of logical faults that can be tested using a given test set T.

Defect Level: Refers to the fraction of shipped parts that are defective. Or, the proportion of the faulty chip in which fault isn’t detected and has been classified as good.
where Y is the yield, means the fraction of the chips fabricated that are good.

## Day-6-Introduction to logic synthesis in DC

<details>
<summary> Introduction </summary>

*Synthesis*
-RTL to Gate level translation.

-The design is converted inta gate and connections are made betn the gates.

-INPUT to Synthesis :     1. RTL      2. .lib

*Contents of .lib*
A typical Liberty file contains detailed information about the behaviour of standard cells, including :
    -Timing Information : This includes delay, transition and capacitance values associated with the standard cells. Timing information specifies how the cells behave under different input conditions.
    -Power Information : Liberty file also provides data on power consumption , including static power and dynamic power characteristics. This information is crucial for optimizing the power consumption in IC.
    -Functional Behaviour : Descriptions of the logical functionality of standard cells, such as input and output pins and logical equations and any additional attributesthat define their operation.
    -Operating Conditions : Liberty files may include information about different operating condition in terms of process , voltage and temperature under which all cells are characterized.
    

*Need of Liberty files*:

Timing Analysis : EDA tools use Liberty files to perform static timing analysis, ensuring that the IC design meets specified timing constraints. This is critical for achieving desired performance targets.

Power Optimization : Power consumption is a significant concern in modern IC design. Liberty files provide power data that allows designers to optimize power usage and meet energy efficiency goals.

Design Closure : During the design process, designers use Liberty files to guide the synthesis, placement, and routing of standard cells. The data in these files helps achieve design closure by ensuring that the design meets performance, power, and area targets.

Variability Handling : Variability in manufacturing processes can impact the behavior of standard cells. Liberty files may include data for different process corners to account for manufacturing variations.



*Constraints*
Constraints are the instructions that the designer apply during various step in VLSI chip implementation, such as logic synthesis, clock tree synthesis, Place and Route, and Static Timing Analysis. They define what the tools can or cannot do with the design or how the tool behaves. In VLSI design, constraints are essential parameters and limitations that guide the development process to ensure that the resulting integrated circuits (ICs) meet specific performance, timing, and functionality requirements. These constraints play a crucial role in achieving a successful VLSI design.

<summary> DC Complier </summary>

Design Compiler ,  is a high-level synthesis tool developed by Synopsys, a leading provider of EDA solutions. It plays a pivotal role in the process of designing complex integrated circuits (ICs) and is an integral part of modern VLSI design flows.

Important terms used

- Synopsys Design Constraints(SDC) : These are the design constraints which are supplied to DC to enable appropriate optimization suitable for achieving the best implementation.
- .lib : Design Library which contains the Standard cells.
- .db : Same as .lib but in a different format. DC understands libraries in .db format
- .ddc : Synopsys propreitary format for storing the design information. DC can write out and read in DDC.
- Design : RTL files which has the behavioral model of the design.

```
                Read STD Cell/tech.lib

*Labs on Design Vision*
To launch Design Vision we need to enable c shell and then give design Vision:
```

After launching the design_vison first we need to the net to .ddc which is read by Design_vision tool which can be done by using the below command
```
write -f ddc -out <filename_name>
```
Then we can start GUI and then read the .ddc file generated above. This ddc file contains all the information of the tool memory of that particular session. ddc is synopys proprietary format i.e it can be read only br synopsys tools.When the .db is read it automatically reads the linked .db file.
If we have an RTL design that we want to synthesize and we have the Verilog code available, we would typically use read_verilog to start the synthesis process. However, if we have a DDC-formatted design from a previous run or from another tool in the Synopsys toolchain, we would use read_ddc to work with that design in Design Compiler's GUI or command-line environment.

## Day-7-Basic of STA

<details>
<summary> Introduction to STA </summary>

STA breaks down the design into time pathways before doing timing analysis. The following factors make up each time path:

Startpoint: The beginning of a timing route in which data is launched by a clock edge or must be ready at a certain moment. Every startpoint must be a register clock pin or an input port.

Combinational logic network: It includes elements with no internal state or memory. AND, OR, XOR, and inverter elements are allowed in combinational logic, but flip-flops, latches, registers, and RAM are not.

Endpoint: When data is caught by a clock edge or when it needs to be provided at a specified moment, this is the end of a timing path. A register data input pin or an output port must be present at each endpoint.

Static timing analysis calculates a maximum delay using the longest way and a minimum delay using the shortest path.

A Setup time (Max Delay Constraint) refers to a design specification or requirement that imposes an upper limit on the delay a signal can experience while propagating through a specific path or circuit within an integrated circuit. Consider a example of 2 D flip flop connected with a combinational logic in between them.

Tck >= Tcq + Tcomb + Tsu

Hold time (Min Delay constraint) refers to a design specification or requirement that sets a minimum allowable delay for a signal to propagate through a specific path or circuit within an integrated circuit. This constraint is used to ensure that certain signals within the circuit do not propagate too quickly, which can lead to timing violations and potential operational issues.

Thold < Tcq + Tcomb

*Timing Arc*
 A timing arc defines the propagation of signals through logic gates/nets and defines a timing relationship between two related pins. Timing arc is one of the components of a timing path. Static timing analysis works on the concept of timing paths. Each path starts from either primary input or a register and ends at a primary output or a register. In-between, the path traverses through what are known as timing arcs. We can define a timing arc as an indivisible path/constraint from one pin to another that tells EDA tool to consider the path/relationship between the pins. For instance, AND, NAND, NOT, full adder cell etc. gates have arcs from each input pin to each output pin.

 Consider a case of 2:1 Mux this has 3 timing arcs

A -> Z

B -> Z

sel -> Z

this implies that Z ooutput can change from either A,B or sel

Sequential Cells Timing arcs

For D flip flop it is Clock to Q delay timing arc and setup , hold time arcs.

For Latches it is clock to Q delay timing arc , D to Q timing arcs ,setup hold time arcs.

Timing paths in VLSI design are specific routes or signal paths within a digital circuit where the timing characteristics, including signal propagation delays, setup times, hold times, and clock-to-q delays, are analyzed to ensure the circuit's correct and reliable operation. These paths are crucial for timing analysis and play a central role in achieving the desired performance and functionality of the integrated circuit. Timing paths typically include a starting point (often a flip-flop or input pin), a set of logic gates and interconnections, and an ending point (another flip-flop or output pin).

Start points of timing path

Input ports
Clock pins of regs
End point of timing path

Output ports
D pin of D flip flop / D Latch
Always the timing path start at one of the start point and ends at one of the end point

Clock -> D (Reg 2 Reg)

Clock -> Output port (I/O timing path)

input port -> D (I/O timing path)

input port -> Output port (These should not be present)

In this Reg 2 Reg is constrained by clock , Reg to out is constrained by Output external delay and clock period , In 2 Reg is constrained by input external delay and clock period.

In addition to this Input transition delaya are also constrained as signal transition are not ideal , As delay are function of input transition delay and load capacitance they both need to be constrain.

Timing File (.lib) consists of ASCII representations of Timing, Area, and Power associated with the Standard cell. The Naming convention in the timing file follows PVT format (Process, Voltage, Temperature). For example, the standard library used in our case was sky130_fd_sc_hd_tt_025C_1v8, this name suggests that we are using 130 nm technology and the process is typical, temperature is 25C, and 1.8 V represents the voltage.
The common part of Lib file contains
- Library name and technology name
- Units (of time, power, voltage, current, resistance and capacitance)
- Value of operating condition ( process, voltage and temperature) – Max, Min and Typical 

<img width="1085" alt="lib1" src="https://github.com/Luffy-7744/Samsung-PD-Training-/blob/8204f51893df840de7100d1c433293e9edb1e96c/PD%23Day7/opening_lib.png">

Based on operating conditions there are three different lib files for Max, Min and Typical corners. In the second part of Lib file, it contains cell-specific information for each cell. 

Cell-specific information in Lib file is mainly
- Cell name
- Pin name
- Area of cell
- Leakage power in respect of input pins logic state.

Also It contains Pins details like
- Pin name
- Pin direction
- Internal power
- Capacitance
- Raise capacitance
- Fall Capacitance
- Fanout load

A Look-Up Table (LUT) in a Liberty file is a component that defines the logical behavior and timing characteristics of a combinational logic cell within a digital library. Liberty files are used in the electronic design automation (EDA) industry to represent libraries of standard cells that can be used in VLSI (Very Large Scale Integration) design.

index1 represents input transition , index2 represeents output load capacitance

*Unateness*
A function is said to be unate if the rise transition on the positive unate input variable causes the ouput to rise or no change and vice versa.

Negative unateness means cell output logic is inverted version of input logic. eg. In inverter having input A and output Y, Y is -ve unate w.r.t A. Positive unate means cell output logic is same as that of input.
These +ve ad -ve unateness are constraints defined in library file and are defined for output pin w.r.t some input pin.

A clock signal is positive unate if a rising edge at the clock source can only cause a rising edge at the register clock pin, and a falling edge at the clock source can only cause a falling edge at the register clock pin.

A clock signal is negative unate if a rising edge at the clock source can only cause a falling edge at the register clock pin, and a falling edge at the clock source can only cause a rising edge at the register clock pin. In other words, the clock signal is inverted.

A clock signal is not unate if the clock sense is ambiguous as a result of non-unate timing arcs in the clock path.

And gate is an example of positive Unateness:

<summary> Clock Terminology </summary>


We know that when the when the clock is constrained , Actually clock period gets constrained , which in turn limits the combinational delay i.e

Tclk >= Tcq + Tcomb + Tst

Tcomb <= Tclk - (Tcq + Tst)



Clock Generator are a critical component of VLSI (Very Large Scale Integration) circuits, playing a fundamental role in synchronizing various components of an integrated circuit (IC). They provide clock signals that control the timing of digital operations within the IC. Clock generators are designed to produce clock signals with specific characteristics, such as frequency, duty cycle, and phase, to meet the requirements of the overall system.

*Types of clock generators*

    - Oscillators: These are widely used as clock generators. They generate continuous periodic signals without an external input. Common types include RC oscillators, LC oscillators, and crystal oscillators.

    - Phase-Locked Loops (PLLs): PLLs are versatile clock generators that can generate clock signals with adjustable frequency and phase. They are often used for clock synchronization and multiplication.

    - Delay-Locked Loops (DLLs): DLLs are used to align the phase of a clock signal with respect to another reference clock signal.

    - Ring Oscillators: These are simple but effective oscillators often used for generating clock signals with relatively low frequencies.

    - Crystal Oscillators: They are highly stable and accurate oscillators that use piezoelectric crystals to generate clock signals.


Consider the above circuit in this the clock arrives at flop B at 100 ps and at flop A at 100 ps. From this it clear that clock doesnot arrive at same time for all flops. This difference in arrival of clock is called skew.

    - Deterministic Clock Skew: Deterministic clock skew is predictable and results from known factors such as wire delays, signal routing, and clock distribution. It is typically caused by the physical characteristics of the circuit and can be analyzed and compensated for during the design phase. Techniques like clock tree synthesis and buffer insertion are used to mitigate deterministic skew.

    - Random Clock Skew: Random clock skew, also known as process-induced skew, is caused by manufacturing process variations that affect the timing of signals. These variations can lead to slightly different propagation delays for clock signals across different parts of a chip. Random skew is not easily predictable and can vary from chip to chip, even within the same manufacturing batch. To address random skew, designers often use techniques like over-design and guard-banding to ensure that the circuit operates reliably under worst-case conditions.

    - Global Clock Skew: Global clock skew refers to the difference in arrival times of a clock signal at various points across the entire chip. It affects all elements of the chip and can lead to synchronization issues between different clock domains. Managing global clock skew is a critical aspect of clock distribution in large and complex integrated circuits. Global skew can be reduced by careful clock tree synthesis and by minimizing the length of critical paths in the design.

    - Local Clock Skew: Local clock skew is specific to a particular region or block within the chip. It can result from variations in the lengths of wires or traces that carry the clock signal to different parts of a block. Local skew is often easier to manage than global skew because it affects a smaller portion of the chip. Techniques like buffer insertion and clock gating can be used to mitigate local clock skew.

Positive and Negative Skew: Clock skew can be further categorized into positive skew and negative skew based on whether clock signals arrive later or earlier than the ideal clock edge, respectively.

        - Positive Skew: Positive skew occurs when clock signals arrive at different destinations later than the ideal clock edge. It can lead to setup time violations.
        - Negative Skew: Negative skew occurs when clock signals arrive earlier than the ideal clock edge at different destinations. Negative skew can result in hold time violations.

Clock Jitter is a timing variation or uncertainty in the period or phase of a clock signal. It represents the deviation of the actual clock signal edges from their ideal, regularly spaced positions. Clock jitter can occur due to various factors and can have significant implications for the performance and reliability of digital systems.

Clock latency refers to the time delay or propagation delay that a clock signal experiences as it travels from its source to various points within an integrated circuit (IC) or digital system. It represents the time it takes for the clock signal to propagate through various components, interconnects, and buffers before reaching its destination.

Source latency: The source latency of a clock, also known as clock source latency, refers to the delay or latency introduced by the clock generation circuitry at its source before the clock signal is distributed to other parts of the integrated circuit (IC) or digital system.

Network latency : Network latency in the context of a clock typically refers to the delay or time delay introduced when transmitting a clock signal across a network or communication medium.

Clock Modelling

We should model the clock for:

    Period
    Source latency
    Clock skew
    Clock Network
    Clock Network latency

By default system gives hierarchical cells:
dc_shell> get_cells * -hier -filter "is_hierarchical == false"
{REGA_reg REGB_reg REGC_reg U9 U10 U11 U12 U13 U14}


For listing Reference cells :

U13 sky130_fd_sc_hd__clkinv_1
U14 sky130_fd_sc_hd__nand2_1

```
Now we convert our design into ddc

dc_shell> write -f ddc -out verilog_files/lab8_circuit.ddc

Then open design_vision gui in another tab read ddc file of lab8.
The schematic of lab8_circuit.ddc as gvien below:

```
design_vision> foreach_in_collection my_pin [all_connected n5] {
set pin_name [get_object_name $my_pin];
set dir [get_attribute [get_pins $pin_name] direction];
echo $pin_name $dir;
}
U11/Y out
U13/A in
U12/B1 in
```
**4. Getting Pin of Design**

```
dc_shell> get_pin *
{REGA_reg/D REGA_reg/CLK REGA_reg/RESET_B REGA_reg/Q REGB_reg/D REGB_reg/CLK REGB_reg/RESET_B REGB_reg/Q REGC_reg/D REGC_reg/CLK REGC_reg/RESET_B REGC_reg/Q U9/A U9/Y U10/A U10/Y U11/A U11/B U11/Y U12/A1 U12/A2 U12/B1 U12/Y U13/A U13/Y U14/A U14/B U14/Y}

Listing it vertically:
dc_shell> foreach_in_collection my_pin [get_pins *] {
set pin_name [get_object_name $my_pin];
echo $pin_name;
}
REGA_reg/D
REGA_reg/CLK
REGA_reg/RESET_B
REGA_reg/Q
REGB_reg/D
REGB_reg/CLK
REGB_reg/RESET_B
REGB_reg/Q
REGC_reg/D
REGC_reg/CLK
REGC_reg/RESET_B
REGC_reg/Q
U9/A
U9/Y
U10/A
U10/Y
U11/A
U11/B
U11/Y
U12/A1
U12/A2
U12/B1
U12/Y
U13/A
U13/Y

After Sourcing tcl file we get this result:
```
dc_shell> source  querry.tcl

```
**5. Creating Clock**

```
dc_shell> create_clock -name MYCLK -per 10 [get_ports clk]

**8. Modeling IO delays**


When we do *report_timing -from IN_A* we get path is unconstrained. We set IO Constrains :
```
dc_shell> set_input_delay -max 5 -clock [get_clocks MYCLK] [get_ports IN_A]
1
dc_shell> set_input_delay -max 5 -clock [get_clocks MYCLK] [get_ports IN_B]
1
dc_shell> set_input_delay -min 1 -clock [get_clocks MYCLK] [get_ports IN_B]
1
dc_shell> set_input_delay -min 1 -clock [get_clocks MYCLK] [get_ports IN_A]
1
dc_shell> set_input_transition -max 0.3 [get_ports IN_A]
1
dc_shell> set_input_transition -max 0.3 [get_ports IN_B]
1
dc_shell> set_input_transition -min 0.1 [get_ports IN_B]
1
dc_shell> set_input_transition -min 0.1 [get_ports IN_A]
1
```

We get report_timing as :

Due to increase in load from 0 to 0.4 the transition time icreased, due to which we have more delay. Slack is also reduced.

assign OUT_Y = ~REGC ;

assign out_clk = clk;

```

Loading the new design and Instead of writting constraints everytime we can create a .tcl program and then source it:

```
create_clock -name MYCLK -per 10 [get_ports clk];
set_clock_latency -source 2 [get_clocks MYCLK];
set_clock_latency 1 [get_clocks MYCLK];
set_clock_uncertainty -setup 0.5 [get_clocks MYCLK];
set_clock_uncertainty -hold 0.1 [get_clocks MYCLK];
set_input_delay -max 4 -clock [get_clocks MYCLK] [get_ports IN_A];
set_input_delay -max 4 -clock [get_clocks MYCLK] [get_ports IN_B];
set_input_delay -min 1 -clock [get_clocks MYCLK] [get_ports IN_A];
set_input_delay -min 1 -clock [get_clocks MYCLK] [get_ports IN_B];
set_input_transition -max 0.4 [get_ports IN_A];
set_input_transition -max 0.4 [get_ports IN_B];
set_input_transition -min 0.1 [get_ports IN_A];
set_input_transition -min 0.1 [get_ports IN_B];
create_generated_clock -name MYGEN_CLK -master MYCLK -source [get_ports clk] -div 1 [get_ports out_clk];
create_generated_clock -name MYGEN_DIV_CLK -master MYCLK -source [get_ports clk] -div 2 [get_ports out_div_clk]; 
set_output_delay -max 4 -clock [get_clocks MYGEN_CLK] [get_ports OUT_Y];
set_output_delay -min 1 -clock [get_clocks MYGEN_CLK] [get_ports OUT_Y];
set_load -max 0.4 [get_ports OUT_Y];
set_load -min 0.1 [get_ports OUT_Y];
```

When we give 
- set_input_delay -max 3 -clock <clock_name> [<definition_point>]

Here -max 3 implies that the data arrives 3 ns late compared to clock

- set_input_delay -max -3 -clock <clock_name> [<definition_point>]

Here the data is arriving 3 ns before the rising edge which helps in setup time

so negative max relaxes the path in case of setup

Positive max tightens the path in case of setup

In case of hold it is the opposite case negative min tightens the path and positive min relaxes the path.

- Now consider the case where two inputs In_C and In_D are given to combinational logic and it should be constraint , This design is independent of the original design.

This can be done by using max_latency or using the virtual lab:
set_max_latency -from [<source_port_name>] -to [<destination_port_name>]

**10. Creating Virtual Clock 

create_clock -name <virtual_clock_name> -period

set_input_delay -max -clock <clock_name> -clock_fall -add [<destination_point>]

Here the -add is signify that we are appending this to already constrained path.

In cases where there are multiple load attached to a net , Transition delay can get further delayed depending on loading strain.

In such cases set_driving_cell is more recommanded.

NOTE

set_input_transition => It is used mainly for top level primary Input/output .
set_driving_cell => It is used for intrernal path.
Command for set_driving_cell is

set_driving_cell -lib_cell <lib_cell_ref_name> [all_inputs]

When we do report_timing -to OUT_Z , we get unconstrained path.

## Day-9-Optimizations

<details>
<summary> Introduction to Combinational and Sequential Optimization </summary>

Optimization in VLSI design is a crucial aspect of creating efficient and high-performance integrated circuits (ICs). VLSI optimization involves improving various aspects of IC design, such as power consumption, area utilization, timing, and manufacturability.

The goals of optimization :

- Cost based Optimization
     Optimization till cost is met
     Over optimization of one goal can harm other goals.


- Performance Optimization:

    Speed: Improve the operational speed of the IC by minimizing delays, optimizing critical paths, and ensuring that the design meets specified timing requirements.
    Throughput: Enhance the overall system throughput by optimizing data flow and minimizing bottlenecks in the circuit.

- Power Optimization:

    Dynamic Power: Minimize dynamic power consumption to extend battery life in portable devices and reduce power dissipation in data centers.
    Static Power: Reduce static power (leakage power) to lower overall power consumption when the IC is in standby or idle mode.

- Goals for Synthesis

    > Meet Timing
    > Meet Area
    > Meet power
    > Meet Quality

    
*Combination logic Optimisation*

Combinational Logic Optimization squeeze the logic to get most optimized design in terms of area and power. There are various techniques for optimizing the circuit

    constant propagation(Direct propagation)
    Boolean Logic Optimization(K-Means ,QUine Mckluskey)

*Sequential Optimization*

Basic Sequential Optimization

    Sequential Constant propagation
    Retiming
    Unused Flop Removal
    Clock Gating

Advanced

    State Optimization
    Sequential logic cloning

*Optimization of Unloaded Outputs*

Optimizing unloaded outputs typically involves reduction of power consumption , area, delay for unused or idle pins . It refers to flip-flops whose outputs are not connected to any subsequent logic gates or do not affect the functionality of the overall circuit. so these flip flops can be removed thus retaining the function and reducing the area , power of the design.

*Controlling sequential optimization*

    compile_seqmap_propagate_constants ----> If this variable is not set to true, the sequential constant propagating circuits are retained in circuit and not optimized.
    compile_delete_unloaded_sequential_cells ----> If the variable is not set to true, it doesn't remove the counter cells as discussed, it retains all counters in the circuit.
    compile_register_replication ----> If the variable is set to true, this replicates the registers in cloning optimization so that timing is met.

Then set_max_delay as 0.06 and do report_timing:
```
design_vision> set_max_delay 0.06 -from [all_inputs] -to [get_ports y]

After report timing it gives same result, Hence further optimization not possbile.

Tie cells

Tie cells also known as tie-high and tie-low cells, are components used in vlsi design to ensure that specific signal are held at a predetermined logic value regardless of input condition. These cells are particularlly useful in preventing floating or undefined states in digital circuit.

**Boundary Optimization**

"Boundary optimization" in VLSI (Very Large Scale Integration) design generally refers to the optimization of boundaries or interfaces between different components or modules within an integrated circuit (IC) or system-on-chip (SoC).

RTL Design code:
```ruby
module check_boundary (input clk , input res , input [3:0] val_in , output reg [3:0] val_out);
wire en;
internal_module u_im (.clk(clk) , .res(res) , .cnt_roll(en));

always @ (posedge clk , posedge res)
begin
	if(res)
		val_out <= 4'b0;
	else if(en)
		val_out <= val_in;

**Register Retiiming**

Register retiming is a technique used in Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) design to optimize the performance of digital circuits by rearranging the registers in the circuit without changing its functionality. The primary goal of register retiming is to minimize the critical path delay, which is the longest path in the circuit from an input to an output.

```ruby
module check_reg_retime (input clk , input [3:0] a, input [3:0] b , output [7:0] c , input reset);

wire [7:0] mult;
assign mult = a * b;
reg [7:0] q1;
reg [7:0] q2;
reg [7:0] q3;




always @ (posedge clk , posedge reset)
begin
	if(reset)
	begin
		q1 <= 8'b0;
		q2 <= 8'b0;
		q3 <= 8'b0;
	end
	else
	begin
		q1 <= mult;
		q2 <= q1;
		q3 <= q2;
	end
end
assign c = q3;

endmodule
```
In order to rectify this we retime it using following command

compile_ultra -retime

**Isolating output ports**

In VLSI (Very Large Scale Integration) design, isolating output ports often refers to ensuring that the output signals of a circuit or module are properly isolated and do not interfere with each other or with other parts of the system. This isolation is crucial for maintaining signal integrity, reducing noise, and preventing unintended interactions.

Isolating Output Ports:

- Purpose: The primary goal of isolating output ports is to decouple the internal logic paths of a digital circuit from the variability in the output load, which can affect the cell delay and potentially lead to the failing of internal paths.

- Cell Delay and Output Load: In digital design, the delay of a logic cell is often a function of the output load it drives. When the output load varies, it can result in changes in cell delay, impacting the operation of internal logic elements.

- Solution: To mitigate this problem, designers use isolation techniques. Isolating output ports typically involves inserting buffers between the output ports and external loads, which effectively decouples the internal logic paths from the output paths.

RTL Design code:
```ruby
module check_boundary (input clk , input res , input [3:0] val_in , output reg [3:0] val_out);
wire en;
internal_module u_im (.clk(clk) , .res(res) , .cnt_roll(en));

always @ (posedge clk , posedge res)
begin
	if(res)
		val_out <= 4'b0;
	else if(en)
		val_out <= val_in;	
end
endmodule


module internal_module (input clk , input res , output cnt_roll);
reg [2:0] cnt;

always @(posedge clk , posedge res)
begin
	if(res)
		cnt <= 3'b0;
	else
		cnt <= cnt + 1;
end

assign cnt_roll = (cnt == 3'b111);

endmodule
```

The command set_isolate_ports –type buffer [all_outputs] instructs the tool to isolate the output ports by inserting buffer elements. Buffers drive the external load, which effectively separates the internal paths from the output paths.
