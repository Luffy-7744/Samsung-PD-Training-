 <summary> Yosys </summary>
Yosys is an open-source framework for Verilog RTL synthesis. RTL stands for Register Transfer Level, which is a high-level abstraction used to describe digital circuits at the level of registers and their interactions. Yosys is primarily used in the digital design and electronic design automation (EDA) community to convert RTL descriptions of digital circuits, written in languages like Verilog or SystemVerilog, into a netlist representation that can be further optimized, analyzed, and eventually implemented in hardware.

I installed Yosys using the following commands and Below is the screenshot showing sucessful launch:

 <summary> ICC2 </summary>

It appears that "icc2 compiler" might refer to an abbreviation of "Intel C++ Compiler 2," which would be the second version of Intel's C++ compiler. Intel's C++ Compiler is a tool used to compile C and C++ programs, optimizing them for Intel processors and architectures. It offers features like advanced vectorization, parallelization, and optimization techniques to enhance the performance of code on Intel-based systems.

I installed ICC2 using the following commands and Below is the screenshot showing sucessful launch:
