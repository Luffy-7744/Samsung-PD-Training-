## Day-1-Introduction to Verilog RTL Design and Synthesis
<details>
 <summary> Introduction to RTL-Design, Test-bench, Simulators </summary>
-RTL Design : The RTL Design stands for Register Transfer Language. It sits between the high-level system specification and the lower-level gate-level implementation. This is a design abstraction which models the flow of digital signals between hardware registers, and the logical operations performed on those signals. RTL is preferred because it is easy to understand and implement compared to structural and behavioral models.

-HDL : A hardware description language (HDL) enables a precise, formal description of an electronic circuit that allows for the automated analysis and simulation of an electronic circuit.

-Simulator : Simulator is the tool used for checking adherence to the specification by simulating the design. iverilog is the tool used for RTL simulation. A simulator looks for change in the input signals and when no change in input, the output also doesn't change. It produces an output in the form of a .vcd file.

-Design : Design is the actual verilog code or set of Verilog codeswhich has the intended functionality to meet the required specifications. Design may have one or more primary inputs or primary outputs.  RTL design is the behavioral representation of the required specification.

<summary> Labs on examples of iverilog and gtkwave </summary>
We made a directory namely VLSI and inside that directory we cloned vsdflow and sky130RTLDesignAndSynthesisWorkshop repository. This repository consists of the required .lib files and verilog codes and its testbenches for practice.
Below is the output wave form in gtkwave generated by performing a simulation of good_mux using iverilog.
The syntax of the code is: iverilog <RTL_code> <Its_Testbench>

 <summary> Introduction to Yosys </summary>
-Synthesis: Synthesis in VLSI is the process of converting your code (program) into a circuit. In terms of logic gates, synthesis is the process of translating an abstract design into a properly implemented chip. It is a process of converting a RTL code into a gate level netlist. The tool used for this purpose is called synthesizer.

-Yosys : Yosys is a framework for RTL synthesis and more. It currently has extensive Verilog-2005 support and provides a basic set of synthesis algorithms for various application domains. Yosys is the core component of most our implementation and verification flows.

-Verification of synthesized design : In order to make sure that there are no errors in netlist we need to verify the netlist generated by synthesizer. This can be done by giving netlist and testbench to a simulator which in turn produces a .vcd file , then verifying the vcd file gtkwave. The output produced by this vcd file should be same as the one generated by the RTL design code.

-Faster Cells Vs Slower Cells :Load in digital circuit is of Capacitence. Faster the charging or dicharging of capacitance, lesser is the celll delay. However, for a quick charge/ discharge of capacitor, we need transistors capable of sourcing more current i.e, we need WIDE TRANSISTORS.

Transistors with higher W/L have lesser delay but consume more area and power while Transistors with less W/L has more delay and less area. Faster cells come with a cost of area and power.

Selection of the Cells: Based on timing constraints we need select the cell. Setup supports faster cells in datapath while hold supports slower. We need to select suitable which can satisfy both constraints.
<details>
 <summary> Lab work on Yosys </summary>
We were given the overview of this tool and the basic files required to perform the experiment on 2:1 MUX.
Procedure : First we need to read the liberty file (.lib) using the code: read_liberty -lib <path of the .lib>


Read the RTL code:

read_verilog <RTL_Design_file>

For synthesis:

synth -top <instance_name>

For Generating netlist:

abc -liberty <.lib path>  --------<present_on_lib_folder>
This Netlist can be viewed in the synthesized circuit form which uses std. cell present in .lib using the show command :

## Day-2-Introduction to Timing libraries, Hierarchical vs flat synthesis, and flip flop coding

<details>
 <summary> Introduction to Timing Library File (.Lib) </summary>
Liberty File(.lib) contains important info about the electrical behavior  of std cells used in IC design. Also, Liberty File(.lib) consists of ASCII representations of Timing, Area, and Power associated with the Standard cell. The Naming convention in the timing file follows technology node and PVT format (Process, Voltage, Temperature). For example, the standard library used in our case was sky130_fd_sc_hd_tt_025C_1v8, this name suggests that we are using 130 nm technology and the process is typical(tt), temperature is 25C, and 1v8 represents the 1.8V.
Screenshot of a standard library file shown below: 
<img width="1085" alt="lib" src="https://github.com/Luffy-7744/Samsung-PD-Training-/blob/6e256528c8de9193640fb445f589071e23beeee5/PD%23Day2/lib_part1.PNG">
	
The Liberty File also consists of the technology used for standard cells as in the above example it is CMOS, it also specifies the delay model, unit of time, unit of voltage, unit of resistance, and many other units.
All the data i.e std cells delays, leakage power, capacitance is stored in form of LUTs. For each gate cell based on the number of inputs(N), there will be 2^N combinations, and for each combination leakage power, area, delay, and all related parameters are mentioned. For example, consider the below screenshot the gate mentioned in the screenshot consists of 4 inputs so there will be 16 combinations, and for all the combinations power, delay, value, and all the features are mentioned below.
<img width="1085" alt="lib1" src="https://github.com/Luffy-7744/Samsung-PD-Training-/blob/6e256528c8de9193640fb445f589071e23beeee5/PD%23Day2/lib_part2.PNG">
	
The timing file consists of many different variations of the same gate cells. As we move toward faster cell (cell with higher drive strength) the area and power increases. In liberty file area, power, timing values are given for same cell of different drive strength and it also consist if the inform about leakage power of all the possible logic of different configration shown below.
<img width="1085" alt="lib1" src="https://github.com/Luffy-7744/Samsung-PD-Training-/blob/a69147a2bedd2c78636125b3b35b7996fa55659e/PD%23Day2/lib_part3.PNG">

<details>
 <summary> Hierarchical vs Flat synthesis in Yosys </summary>
Hierarchical synthesis : The basic flow of hierarchical design is Dividing a design into multiple blocks (i.e. sub-chips, sub-blocks, modules, hierarchical blocks, etc.) which can also be user defined. Hierarchial design has blocks, subblocks in an hierarchy.
In Yosys we have done synthesis of a multimodule combinational circuit which consists of two sub_modules one that of ** AND ** gate and other of ** OR ** gate. Below is the RTL Design code of multimodules is gvien below:
	Synthesis Simulation Mismatch
```
module sub_module2 (input a, input b, output y);
        assign y = a | b;
endmodule

module sub_module1 (input a, input b, output y);
        assign y = a&b;
endmodule
```

module multiple_modules (input a, input b, input c , output y);
        wire net1;
        sub_module1 u1(.a(a),.b(b),.y(net1));  //net1 = a&b
        sub_module2 u2(.a(net1),.b(c),.y(y));  //y = net1|c ,ie y = a&b + c;
endmodule
```
We do synthesis in yosys it generates the following gate level netlist :

<img width="1085" alt="lib" src="https://github.com/Luffy-7744/Samsung-PD-Training-/blob/7d2732dc1300198990edfb77ed38ef0cff0db911/PD%23Day2/hire_synth.PNG">

The yosys considers the module hierarchy and does mapping according to the instantiation i.e by using sub blocks.The netlist code for hierarchical implementation of the multiple_modules.
```
module multiple_modules(a, b, c, y);
	  input a;
	 input b;
	 input c;
	  wire net1;
	 output y;
  sub_module1 u1 (.a(a),.b(b),.y(net1) );
  sub_module2 u2 (.a(net1),.b(c),.y(y));
endmodule

module sub_module1(a, b, y);
 wire _0_;
 wire _1_;
 wire _2_;
 input a;
 input b;
 output y;
 sky130_fd_sc_hd__and2_0 _3_ (.A(_1_),.B(_0_),.X(_2_));
 assign _1_ = b;
 assign _0_ = a;
 assign y = _2_;
endmodule

module sub_module2(a, b, y);
wire _0_;
 wire _1_;
 wire _2_;
input a;
input b;
 output y;
 sky130_fd_sc_hd__lpflow_inputiso1p_1 _3_ (.A(_1_),.SLEEP(_0_),.X(_2_) );
 assign _1_ = b;
 assign _0_ = a;
 assign y = _2_;
endmodule
```
In the netlist it can observed that separate modules namely sub_module1 sub_module2 are created  i.e submodules are getting instanstiated not the std cells present in library.

Flat synthesis : In Flat synthesis the hierarchies the flattened out and every submodule is created using std cells. We apply flat synthesis on the same design mentioned above. The command used to perform Flat synthesis from yosys are as follows :

--- read_liberty -lib <path of the .lib>

--- read_verilog <RTL_file>

--- synth -top <instance_name>

--- abc -liberty <.lib_path>

--- flatten

--- write_verilog -noattr <.v_File_name>
The synthesized circuit for a flattened netlist is shown in the below:

 <summary> Flip-flop Coding Styles </summary>

 Flip-flops :A flip-flop is a sequential digital electronic circuit having two stable states that can be used to store one bit of binary data. Flip-flops are the fundamental building blocks of all memory devices.

 The complexity of cobinational circuit increases the chance of glitch, hence FFs are used to avoid it and it stable output.

 <summary> Optimization Techniques </summary>
 The Optimization involves the reducing hardware in the design to improve area, power and speed. Two example where given:
 1. a*2
Consider a case where 3 bit number is multiplied by 2 in this case we dont need any additional hardware and only needs connecting bits to the output and grounding the LSB bit,same is realized by yosys. When binary number is multiplied by 2^n then result will gave same number by appending zero in LSB by n times.
RTL code:
	
```
	module mul2 (input [2:0] a, output [3:0] y);
	assign y = a * 2; // assign y={a,1'b0}
	endmodule
```

Yosys Synthesis result :

 2. a*9
Multiplying a 3 bit number by 9, gives results as concatination of same number twice {a,a}.
a*[8+1]= {a,0,0,0} + a(3bit)={a,a}

RTL code:

```
module mul8 (input [2:0] a, output [5:0] y);
	assign y = a * 9; // assign y={a,a}
endmodule
```

## Day-3- Combinational and sequential optmizations

<details>
 <summary> Combinational Optimization </summary>
Optimising the combinational logic circuit is squeezing the logic to get the most optimized digital design so that the circuit finally is area and power efficient. This is achieved by the synthesis tool using various techniques and gives us the most optimized circuit.
Command to optimize the circuit by yosys is yosys> opt_clean -purge
We have done synthesis using yosys for few examples:

*Example 1*
```
module opt_check (input a , input b , output y);
	assign y = a?b:0;
endmodule
```
yosys generated gui:

In this verilog code represents the mux but as one of the input 0 , it infers an AND gate as shown in synthesis.


*Example 2*
```
module opt_check2 (input a , input b , output y);
	assign y = a?1:b;
endmodule
```

In this verilog code represents the mux but as one of the input 1, it infers an AND gate as shown in synthesis.

*Example 3*
```
module opt_check3 (input a , input b, input c , output y);

In this verilog code represents the 2 mux but as two of the input 0, it infers an 3 i/p AND gate as shown in synthesis.


*Example 4*
```
module opt_check4 (input a , input b , input c , output y);
	assign y = a?(b?(a & c ):c):(!c);
endmodule
```

 <summary> Sequential Optimization </summary>
There are various techniques for Sequential Logic Optimization

    - Sequentialal constant propagation

    - Advanced

        - State Optimization

        - Retiming

        - Sequential Logic cloning

 Sequential Constant Propogation

Consider a case where asynchronous reset D Flip-flop is fed with d = 0(i.e GND) always so the output will always be 0 irrespective of the timing or circuit.

 Advanced

State Optimisation: This is optimisation of unused state. Using this technique we can come up with most optimised state machine.

Cloning : It is an optimization technique that duplicates a cell to reduce the load on heavily loaded cell. This technique is usually preffered while performing PHYSICAL AWARE SYNTHESIS. Lets consider a flop A which is connected to flop B and flop C through a combination logic. If B and C are placed far from A in the flooerplan, there is a routing path delay. To avoid this, we connect A to two intermediate flops and then from these flops the output is sent to B and C thereby decreasing the delay. This process is called cloning since we are generating two new flops with same functionality as A.

Retiming : Sequential circuits can be optimised by retiming. The combinational section of the circuitry is unaffected as it only rearranges the registers in the circuit. It is a powerful sequential optimization technique used to move registers across the combinational logic or to optimize the number of registers to improve performance via power-delay trade-off, without changing the input-output behavior of the circuit.

Sequential Constant Propogation

Consider a case where asynchronous reset D Flip-flop is fed with d = 0(i.e GND) always so the output will always be 0 irrespective of the timing or circuit.

## Day-4- GLS,blocking vs non-blocking and Synthesis-Simulation mismatch

<details>
<summary> GLS Concepts And Flow Using Iverilog </summary>

-- What is GLS- Gate Level Simulation?:
GLS is generating the simulation output by running test bench with netlist file generated from synthesis as design under test. Netlist is logically same as RTL code, therefore, same test bench can be used for it.

-- Why GLS?:
We perform this to verify logical correctness of the design after synthesizing it. Also ensuring the timing of the design is met.

Below picture gives an insight of the procedure. Here while using iverilog, we also include gate level verilog models to generate GLS simulation.

<img width="1085" alt="lib1" src="https://github.com/Luffy-7744/Samsung-PD-Training-/blob/d17cd858582bb157db097c5bdab07548794e008d/PD%23Day4/IMG_6766.png">
Example :
<img width="1085" alt="lib1" src="https://github.com/Luffy-7744/Samsung-PD-Training-/blob/8d9343b03653b5480cb54ca9d97e32782986ba8c/PD%23Day4/IMG_6768.jpeg">

*Synthesis Simulation Mismatch* 
There are three main reasons for Synthesis Simulation Mismatch:

   -- Missing sensitivity list in always block
   -- Blocking vs Non-Blocking Assignments
   -- Non standard Verilog coding
Missing sensitivity list in always block:
Lets take example of mux having inputs as i0,i1 and sel and output as y.
```
always @(sel)                  always @(*)
//It will infer a latch        // It will infer a mux.
```
If i0 and i1 changes will not be reflected in always block.
To avoid the synthesis and simulation mismatch. It is very important to check the behaviour of the circuit first and then match it with the expected output seen in simulation and make sure there are no synthesis and simulation mismatches. This is why we use GLS.

Blocking vs Non-Blocking Assignments:
Blocking statements execute the statemetns in the order they are written inside the always block. Non-Blocking statements execute all the assignment parallelly inside a always block.
This will give mismatch as sometimes, improper use of blocking statements can create latches. 
Example
<img width="1085" alt="lib1" src="https://github.com/Luffy-7744/Samsung-PD-Training-/blob/8d9343b03653b5480cb54ca9d97e32782986ba8c/PD%23Day4/IMG_6769.jpeg">

## Day-5-Design For Testabilty(DFT)

<details>
<summary> Introduction to DFT </summary>
	
**What is Design for Testability, and why we need it?**

Today, semiconductors lie at the heart of ongoing advances across the electronics industry. The introduction of new technologies, has allowed the semiconductor industry to keep pace with increased performance-capacity demands from consumers. This has brightened the prospects for future industry growth.
However, new technologies come with new challenges. Smaller die sizes increase the probability of some errors. Errors in ICs are highly undesirable. 
In simple words, Design for testability is a design technique that makes testing a chip possible and cost-effective by adding additional circuitry to the chip.
Alternatively, Design-for-testability techniques improve the controllability and observability of internal nodes, so that embedded functions can be tested.

Now, Question arrises what is controllability and observability in design.
*Controllability*: Ability to establish aspecific signal value at each node in a circuit from setting values at the circuits inputs.
*Observability*: Ability to determine the signal value at any node in circuit by controlling the circuits input and observing its output.

**Role of DFT**
Testing of Sequential Circuits :
DFT offers a solution to the issue of testing sequential circuits. It’s kind of hard to test sequential circuits. Since there are clocks involved along with the flip-flops.
Unlike combinational circuits, we can’t determine the output of sequential circuits by merely looking into the inputs. Sequential circuits consist of finite states. The output also depends upon the state of the machine. It is difficult to control and observe the internal flip-flops externally.
Hence, the state machines cannot be tested unless they are initialized to a known value. And to initialize them, we need a specific set of features in addition to the typical circuitry. DFT enables us to add this functionality to a sequential circuit and thus allows us to test it.


**Can DFT permanently eliminate faults?**

No, faults can arise even after the chip is in consumer’s hands. A chip may misbehave anytime if it is exposed to a very high temperature or humid environment or due to aging.
You can even generate a fault on your own. A chip can’t ever be made resistant to faults; they are always bound to occur. So, what are we trying to achieve? Testing a device increases our confidence. By testing a chip, vendors try to minimize the possibility of future errors and failures.
To ensure the highest quality of chips, there is also an auxiliary process involved in the chip-design process called Verification.



**Some Terminologies**

Here are a few terminologies which we will often use in this free Design for Testability course. Don’t fret if you can’t completely understand them yet, we will be covering them in-depth in this course.

Testing: An experiment in which the system is put to work and its resulting response is analyzed to ascertain whether it behaved correctly.

Diagnosis: Process for locating the cause of misbehavior in the circuit if it happened.

Defect: Refers to a flaw in the actual hardware or electronic system.

Fault: It is a model or representation of defect for analyzing in a computer program.

Error: It is caused by a defect and happens when a fault in hardware causes line/ gate output to have a wrong value.

Failure: This occurs when a defect causes misbehavior in the circuit or functionality of a system and cannot be reversed or recovered.

Fault Coverage: Percentage of the total number of logical faults that can be tested using a given test set T.

Defect Level: Refers to the fraction of shipped parts that are defective. Or, the proportion of the faulty chip in which fault isn’t detected and has been classified as good.
where Y is the yield, means the fraction of the chips fabricated that are good.

## Day-6-Introduction to logic synthesis in DC

<details>
<summary> Introduction </summary>

*Synthesis*
-RTL to Gate level translation.

-The design is converted inta gate and connections are made betn the gates.

-INPUT to Synthesis :     1. RTL      2. .lib

*Contents of .lib*
A typical Liberty file contains detailed information about the behaviour of standard cells, including :
    -Timing Information : This includes delay, transition and capacitance values associated with the standard cells. Timing information specifies how the cells behave under different input conditions.
    -Power Information : Liberty file also provides data on power consumption , including static power and dynamic power characteristics. This information is crucial for optimizing the power consumption in IC.
    -Functional Behaviour : Descriptions of the logical functionality of standard cells, such as input and output pins and logical equations and any additional attributesthat define their operation.
    -Operating Conditions : Liberty files may include information about different operating condition in terms of process , voltage and temperature under which all cells are characterized.
    

*Need of Liberty files*:

Timing Analysis : EDA tools use Liberty files to perform static timing analysis, ensuring that the IC design meets specified timing constraints. This is critical for achieving desired performance targets.

Power Optimization : Power consumption is a significant concern in modern IC design. Liberty files provide power data that allows designers to optimize power usage and meet energy efficiency goals.

Design Closure : During the design process, designers use Liberty files to guide the synthesis, placement, and routing of standard cells. The data in these files helps achieve design closure by ensuring that the design meets performance, power, and area targets.

Variability Handling : Variability in manufacturing processes can impact the behavior of standard cells. Liberty files may include data for different process corners to account for manufacturing variations.



*Constraints*
Constraints are the instructions that the designer apply during various step in VLSI chip implementation, such as logic synthesis, clock tree synthesis, Place and Route, and Static Timing Analysis. They define what the tools can or cannot do with the design or how the tool behaves. In VLSI design, constraints are essential parameters and limitations that guide the development process to ensure that the resulting integrated circuits (ICs) meet specific performance, timing, and functionality requirements. These constraints play a crucial role in achieving a successful VLSI design.

<summary> DC Complier </summary>

Design Compiler ,  is a high-level synthesis tool developed by Synopsys, a leading provider of EDA solutions. It plays a pivotal role in the process of designing complex integrated circuits (ICs) and is an integral part of modern VLSI design flows.

Important terms used

- Synopsys Design Constraints(SDC) : These are the design constraints which are supplied to DC to enable appropriate optimization suitable for achieving the best implementation.
- .lib : Design Library which contains the Standard cells.
- .db : Same as .lib but in a different format. DC understands libraries in .db format
- .ddc : Synopsys propreitary format for storing the design information. DC can write out and read in DDC.
- Design : RTL files which has the behavioral model of the design.

```
                Read STD Cell/tech.lib

*Labs on Design Vision*
To launch Design Vision we need to enable c shell and then give design Vision:
```

After launching the design_vison first we need to the net to .ddc which is read by Design_vision tool which can be done by using the below command
```
write -f ddc -out <filename_name>
```
Then we can start GUI and then read the .ddc file generated above. This ddc file contains all the information of the tool memory of that particular session. ddc is synopys proprietary format i.e it can be read only br synopsys tools.When the .db is read it automatically reads the linked .db file.
If we have an RTL design that we want to synthesize and we have the Verilog code available, we would typically use read_verilog to start the synthesis process. However, if we have a DDC-formatted design from a previous run or from another tool in the Synopsys toolchain, we would use read_ddc to work with that design in Design Compiler's GUI or command-line environment.

## Day-7-Basic of STA

<details>
<summary> Introduction to STA </summary>

STA breaks down the design into time pathways before doing timing analysis. The following factors make up each time path:

Startpoint: The beginning of a timing route in which data is launched by a clock edge or must be ready at a certain moment. Every startpoint must be a register clock pin or an input port.

Combinational logic network: It includes elements with no internal state or memory. AND, OR, XOR, and inverter elements are allowed in combinational logic, but flip-flops, latches, registers, and RAM are not.

Endpoint: When data is caught by a clock edge or when it needs to be provided at a specified moment, this is the end of a timing path. A register data input pin or an output port must be present at each endpoint.

Static timing analysis calculates a maximum delay using the longest way and a minimum delay using the shortest path.

A Setup time (Max Delay Constraint) refers to a design specification or requirement that imposes an upper limit on the delay a signal can experience while propagating through a specific path or circuit within an integrated circuit. Consider a example of 2 D flip flop connected with a combinational logic in between them.

Tck >= Tcq + Tcomb + Tsu

Hold time (Min Delay constraint) refers to a design specification or requirement that sets a minimum allowable delay for a signal to propagate through a specific path or circuit within an integrated circuit. This constraint is used to ensure that certain signals within the circuit do not propagate too quickly, which can lead to timing violations and potential operational issues.

Thold < Tcq + Tcomb

*Timing Arc*
 A timing arc defines the propagation of signals through logic gates/nets and defines a timing relationship between two related pins. Timing arc is one of the components of a timing path. Static timing analysis works on the concept of timing paths. Each path starts from either primary input or a register and ends at a primary output or a register. In-between, the path traverses through what are known as timing arcs. We can define a timing arc as an indivisible path/constraint from one pin to another that tells EDA tool to consider the path/relationship between the pins. For instance, AND, NAND, NOT, full adder cell etc. gates have arcs from each input pin to each output pin.

 Consider a case of 2:1 Mux this has 3 timing arcs

A -> Z

B -> Z

sel -> Z

this implies that Z ooutput can change from either A,B or sel

Sequential Cells Timing arcs

For D flip flop it is Clock to Q delay timing arc and setup , hold time arcs.

For Latches it is clock to Q delay timing arc , D to Q timing arcs ,setup hold time arcs.

Timing paths in VLSI design are specific routes or signal paths within a digital circuit where the timing characteristics, including signal propagation delays, setup times, hold times, and clock-to-q delays, are analyzed to ensure the circuit's correct and reliable operation. These paths are crucial for timing analysis and play a central role in achieving the desired performance and functionality of the integrated circuit. Timing paths typically include a starting point (often a flip-flop or input pin), a set of logic gates and interconnections, and an ending point (another flip-flop or output pin).

Start points of timing path

Input ports
Clock pins of regs
End point of timing path

Output ports
D pin of D flip flop / D Latch
Always the timing path start at one of the start point and ends at one of the end point

Clock -> D (Reg 2 Reg)

Clock -> Output port (I/O timing path)

input port -> D (I/O timing path)

input port -> Output port (These should not be present)

In this Reg 2 Reg is constrained by clock , Reg to out is constrained by Output external delay and clock period , In 2 Reg is constrained by input external delay and clock period.

In addition to this Input transition delaya are also constrained as signal transition are not ideal , As delay are function of input transition delay and load capacitance they both need to be constrain.

Timing File (.lib) consists of ASCII representations of Timing, Area, and Power associated with the Standard cell. The Naming convention in the timing file follows PVT format (Process, Voltage, Temperature). For example, the standard library used in our case was sky130_fd_sc_hd_tt_025C_1v8, this name suggests that we are using 130 nm technology and the process is typical, temperature is 25C, and 1.8 V represents the voltage.
The common part of Lib file contains
- Library name and technology name
- Units (of time, power, voltage, current, resistance and capacitance)
- Value of operating condition ( process, voltage and temperature) – Max, Min and Typical 

<img width="1085" alt="lib1" src="https://github.com/Luffy-7744/Samsung-PD-Training-/blob/8204f51893df840de7100d1c433293e9edb1e96c/PD%23Day7/opening_lib.png">

Based on operating conditions there are three different lib files for Max, Min and Typical corners. In the second part of Lib file, it contains cell-specific information for each cell. 

Cell-specific information in Lib file is mainly
- Cell name
- Pin name
- Area of cell
- Leakage power in respect of input pins logic state.

Also It contains Pins details like
- Pin name
- Pin direction
- Internal power
- Capacitance
- Raise capacitance
- Fall Capacitance
- Fanout load

A Look-Up Table (LUT) in a Liberty file is a component that defines the logical behavior and timing characteristics of a combinational logic cell within a digital library. Liberty files are used in the electronic design automation (EDA) industry to represent libraries of standard cells that can be used in VLSI (Very Large Scale Integration) design.

index1 represents input transition , index2 represeents output load capacitance

*Unateness*
A function is said to be unate if the rise transition on the positive unate input variable causes the ouput to rise or no change and vice versa.

Negative unateness means cell output logic is inverted version of input logic. eg. In inverter having input A and output Y, Y is -ve unate w.r.t A. Positive unate means cell output logic is same as that of input.
These +ve ad -ve unateness are constraints defined in library file and are defined for output pin w.r.t some input pin.

A clock signal is positive unate if a rising edge at the clock source can only cause a rising edge at the register clock pin, and a falling edge at the clock source can only cause a falling edge at the register clock pin.

A clock signal is negative unate if a rising edge at the clock source can only cause a falling edge at the register clock pin, and a falling edge at the clock source can only cause a rising edge at the register clock pin. In other words, the clock signal is inverted.

A clock signal is not unate if the clock sense is ambiguous as a result of non-unate timing arcs in the clock path.

And gate is an example of positive Unateness:
