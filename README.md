 <summary> Yosys </summary>
Yosys is an open-source framework for Verilog RTL synthesis. RTL stands for Register Transfer Level, which is a high-level abstraction used to describe digital circuits at the level of registers and their interactions. Yosys is primarily used in the digital design and electronic design automation (EDA) community to convert RTL descriptions of digital circuits, written in languages like Verilog or SystemVerilog, into a netlist representation that can be further optimized, analyzed, and eventually implemented in hardware.

I installed Yosys using the following commands and Below is the screenshot showing sucessful launch:

 <summary> ICC2 </summary>

It appears that "icc2 compiler" might refer to an abbreviation of "Intel C++ Compiler 2," which would be the second version of Intel's C++ compiler. Intel's C++ Compiler is a tool used to compile C and C++ programs, optimizing them for Intel processors and architectures. It offers features like advanced vectorization, parallelization, and optimization techniques to enhance the performance of code on Intel-based systems.

I installed ICC2 using the following commands and Below is the screenshot showing sucessful launch:

 <summary> lc_shell </summary>

LC_shell, also known as Design Compiler Graphical, is a part of the Synopsys suite of Electronic Design Automation (EDA) tools. It's used in the digital design flow for logic synthesis and optimization. Design Compiler Graphical is an advanced version of the original Design Compiler tool, providing additional features and a more user-friendly graphical interface.
I invoked lc_shell using the following commands and Below is the screenshot showing sucessful launch:

 <summary> dc_shell </summary>

Design Compiler is a widely used electronic design automation (EDA) tool developed by Synopsys. It's primarily used for logic synthesis in digital integrated circuit design. Logic synthesis involves transforming a high-level description of a digital circuit (usually written in hardware description languages like Verilog or VHDL) into a lower-level representation made up of gates, flip-flops, and other basic digital components.
I invoked dc_shell using the following commands and Below is the screenshot showing sucessful launch:

 <summary> pt_shell </summary>

"PrimeTime" is a widely used Electronic Design Automation (EDA) tool developed by Synopsys. It is used for static timing analysis, which is a crucial step in the digital design flow to ensure that the design meets its timing requirements. The "PrimeTime Shell" is the user interface through which engineers interact with the PrimeTime tool to perform timing analysis and optimization.
I invoked pt_shell using the following commands and Below is the screenshot showing sucessful launch:
