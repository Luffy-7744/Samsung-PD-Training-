 <summary> Yosys </summary>
Yosys is an open-source framework for Verilog RTL synthesis. RTL stands for Register Transfer Level, which is a high-level abstraction used to describe digital circuits at the level of registers and their interactions. Yosys is primarily used in the digital design and electronic design automation (EDA) community to convert RTL descriptions of digital circuits, written in languages like Verilog or SystemVerilog, into a netlist representation that can be further optimized, analyzed, and eventually implemented in hardware.

I installed Yosys using the following commands and Below is the screenshot showing sucessful launch:

 <summary> GTK Wave </summary>

GTKWave is an open-source waveform viewer and analyzer primarily used in digital design and electronic design automation (EDA) workflows. It allows users to visualize and analyze the waveforms generated by digital simulations, making it a valuable tool for debugging and verifying digital designs.

I installed GTKwave using the following commands and Below is the screenshot showing sucessful launch:

 <summary> ICC2 </summary>

It appears that "icc2 compiler" might refer to an abbreviation of "Intel C++ Compiler 2," which would be the second version of Intel's C++ compiler. Intel's C++ Compiler is a tool used to compile C and C++ programs, optimizing them for Intel processors and architectures. It offers features like advanced vectorization, parallelization, and optimization techniques to enhance the performance of code on Intel-based systems.

I installed ICC2 using the following commands and Below is the screenshot showing sucessful launch:

 <summary> lc_shell </summary>

LC_shell, also known as Design Compiler Graphical, is a part of the Synopsys suite of Electronic Design Automation (EDA) tools. It's used in the digital design flow for logic synthesis and optimization. Design Compiler Graphical is an advanced version of the original Design Compiler tool, providing additional features and a more user-friendly graphical interface.
I invoked lc_shell using the following commands and Below is the screenshot showing sucessful launch:

 <summary> dc_shell </summary>

Design Compiler is a widely used electronic design automation (EDA) tool developed by Synopsys. It's primarily used for logic synthesis in digital integrated circuit design. Logic synthesis involves transforming a high-level description of a digital circuit (usually written in hardware description languages like Verilog or VHDL) into a lower-level representation made up of gates, flip-flops, and other basic digital components.
I invoked dc_shell using the following commands and Below is the screenshot showing sucessful launch:

 <summary> pt_shell </summary>

"PrimeTime" is a widely used Electronic Design Automation (EDA) tool developed by Synopsys. It is used for static timing analysis, which is a crucial step in the digital design flow to ensure that the design meets its timing requirements. The "PrimeTime Shell" is the user interface through which engineers interact with the PrimeTime tool to perform timing analysis and optimization.

## Day-1-Introduction to Verilog RTL Design and Synthesis
<details>
 <summary> Introduction to RTL-Design, Test-bench, Simulators </summary>
-RTL Design : The RTL Design stands for Register Transfer Language. It sits between the high-level system specification and the lower-level gate-level implementation. This is a design abstraction which models the flow of digital signals between hardware registers, and the logical operations performed on those signals. RTL is preferred because it is easy to understand and implement compared to structural and behavioral models.

-HDL : A hardware description language (HDL) enables a precise, formal description of an electronic circuit that allows for the automated analysis and simulation of an electronic circuit.

-Simulator : Simulator is the tool used for checking adherence to the specification by simulating the design. iverilog is the tool used for RTL simulation. A simulator looks for change in the input signals and when no change in input, the output also doesn't change. It produces an output in the form of a .vcd file.

-Design : Design is the actual verilog code or set of Verilog codeswhich has the intended functionality to meet the required specifications. Design may have one or more primary inputs or primary outputs.  RTL design is the behavioral representation of the required specification.

<summary> Labs on examples of iverilog and gtkwave </summary>
We made a directory namely VLSI and inside that directory we cloned vsdflow and sky130RTLDesignAndSynthesisWorkshop repository. This repository consists of the required .lib files and verilog codes and its testbenches for practice.
Below is the output wave form in gtkwave generated by performing a simulation of good_mux using iverilog.
The syntax of the code is: iverilog <RTL_code> <Its_Testbench>
